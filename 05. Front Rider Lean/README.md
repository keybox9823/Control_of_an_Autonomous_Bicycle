# Rider Lean

Imagine a situation in which the bicycle is driving along a straight path on the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\xi">-axis, and a car suddenly appears on the right. The rider must apply a torque on the handlebar to steer away from the vehicle reaching, say, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\eta = 2"> m as fast as possible without losing stability. We need a dynamic controller to generate the needed torque <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=T">.
